# ConcurrentTest

A demonstration of how I use
[ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) in concert with
concurrent `DispatchQueue`s.

## Usage

At the terminal, run the following:

``` bash
swift package generate-xcodeproj
open ConcurrentTest.xcodeproj
```

Then, choose the ConcurrentTest scheme and run. Read
`Sources/ConcurrentTest/main.swift` for more details.
